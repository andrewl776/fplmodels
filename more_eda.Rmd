```{r}
library(corrplot)
library(GGally)
library(tidyverse)

gw_data <- readr::read_rds("data/players_by_gameweek.rds")

gw_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ep_next)) + 
  geom_density()
```

Not quite log normal.

```{r}
gw_data %>% 
  mutate(chance_of_playing_this_round = replace_na(chance_of_playing_this_round, 100)) %>% 
  group_by(chance_of_playing_this_round) %>% 
  summarise("mean_mins" = mean(minutes, na.rm = TRUE), "n" = n()) %>% 
  mutate(chance_of_playing_this_round = factor(chance_of_playing_this_round)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = mean_mins, fill = chance_of_playing_this_round, 
             x = chance_of_playing_this_round)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_label(aes(label = n))
```


Nothing too useful here.

```{r}
gw_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = selected_by_percent, y = next_gw_points))
```
